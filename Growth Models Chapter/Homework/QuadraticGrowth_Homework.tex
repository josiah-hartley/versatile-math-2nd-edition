\item Use a graphing calculator or spreadsheet program to find a quadratic model that best fits this data, using angle as $x$ and distance as $y$.
\item Based on this model, what distance is expected for a ball hit at 55$^\circ$?
\item What distance is expected for a ball hit at 75$^\circ$?
\item Which of the two previous predictions is likely to be more reliable?
\item What angle above 45$^\circ$ would you expect to yield a distance of 200 feet?
