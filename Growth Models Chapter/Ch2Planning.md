## 2.1 Linear Models
* [X] Focus more on explicit form; remove recursive form altogether?
* [X] Keep using first and last points to build line manually, but...
* [X] Add linear regression (calculator only); compare to manual method
* [X] Show how to use intersect function in calculator to find t (will use for other sections)
* [X] Add "Using Excel"

## 2.2 Quadratic Models
* [X] Introduction?
* [X] Graphs
* [X] Using QuadReg on calculator
* [X] Using Excel

## 2.3 Exponential Models
* [X] Add introduction
* [X] Add example about deciding what type of model to use (linear, exponential (include quadratic?))
* [X] Show how to use intersect function to solve, rather than using algebra (after one example of doing it manually)
* [X] Find a better way to distinguish between two exponential models (or just pick one and stick with it?)
* [X] Remove Newton's Law of Cooling
* [X] Using calculator: ExpReg
* [X] Using Excel

## 2.4 Logistic Models
* [X] Add introduction
* [X] Use intersect to solve
* [X] Using calculator: Logistic
