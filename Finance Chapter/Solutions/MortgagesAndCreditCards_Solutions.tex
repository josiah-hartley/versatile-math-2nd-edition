Original loan payment: $PMT = \dfrac{175,000\left(\dfrac{0.038}{12}\right)}{1-\left(1+\dfrac{0.038}{12}\right)^{-(12)(30)}} = 815.43$\\
Total cost of original loan: $(815.43)(12)(30) = 293,554.80$\\
Second loan payment: $PMT = \dfrac{175,000\left(\dfrac{0.031}{12}\right)}{1-\left(1+\dfrac{0.031}{12}\right)^{-(12)(30)}} = 747.28$\\

Total cost of second loan: $(1644.89)(12)(20) = 394,773.60$\\
Interest cost of second loan: $394,773.60 - 260,000 = 134,773.60$\\ \text{}\\
