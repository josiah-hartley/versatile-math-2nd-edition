%%% Disjoint %%%
In this section, we will focus on computing probabilities of events involving ``or'' as well as learning the concept of mutually exclusive events. We will also discuss complementary events and their probabilities. 

To start, recall the experiment of drawing one card from a standard deck of cards. Let $J$ denote drawing a Jack, and $Q$ denote drawing a Queen. What is the probability of drawing a Jack? It is, of course, 4/52, and the same goes for the probability of drawing a Queen. Now, what is the probability of drawing a Jack \emph{OR} Queen?  By looking back at the deck of cards, we can see that there are 8 cards that are either Jacks or Queens, so 
\[P(J \ OR \ Q)=\dfrac{8}{52},\]
which happens to be the sum of their individual probabilities.

What about, though, if we wanted to find the probability of drawing a Jack or a diamond?  Could we just add their individual probabilities (4/52 and 13/52, respectively)?  Let's check by looking back at the cards and see which correspond to Jacks or diamonds.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{playingcardsJD}
\end{center}
Notice that there are 16 cards that match that description, so the probability is 16/32, which ISN'T the sum of the individual probabilities.  What went wrong?

\subsection{Mutually Exclusive Events}
The answer can be found by looking at the diagram above.  Notice that if we add up the number of Jacks and the number of diamonds (for a total of 17), we \textit{double count} the Jack of diamonds.  This brings us to an important definition that determines how we find the probability of one event OR another occurring: we need to find whether the events are \textbf{mutually exclusive} or \textbf{disjoint}.  That is, can these two events happen at the same time?
\begin{proc}{Disjoint (Mutually Exclusive) Outcomes}
Two outcomes are called \textbf{disjoint} or \textbf{mutually exclusive} if they cannot both happen at the same time.
\end{proc}
Can we draw a card that is both Jack and Queen? Clearly, there is no such card, therefore these events are disjoint. Another familiar example of disjoint events would be getting an even number and getting an odd number when rolling a die. Each number is either even or odd, so these two events are also mutually exclusive.  Above, though, we showed that drawing a Jack and drawing a diamond are NOT mutually exclusive, since you can draw the Jack of diamonds.

Notice that the terms \textbf{disjoint} and \textbf{mutually exclusive}
are equivalent and interchangeable. The Venn diagram below illustrates the concept of mutually exclusive events: two events $A$ and $B$ do not overlap; they are disjoint. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw [ultra thick,color=red, fill=red!20] (-1.5,0) circle (0.9cm);
  \draw [yshift=-1.3cm,xshift=-1.5cm] node {\color{red}\Large $A$};
  
  \draw [ultra thick,color=blue, fill=blue!20] (1.5,0) circle (0.9cm);
  \draw [yshift=-1.3cm,xshift=1.5cm] node {\color{blue}\Large $B$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

 Before we formally define a formula for computing probabilities of disjoint events, let us solve some problems by using the rules we already know.

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=473To7lQQyI]{Rolling a die}
Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die once. What is the probability of rolling a 6 or an odd number? 

\sol
Since 6 is even, these two events are disjoint; this means that we can simply add the probabilities for rolling a 6 and rolling an odd number:
\begin{align*}
P( O \mbox{ or } 6 ) &= P(O) + P(6) \\
&= \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667}
\end{align*}
\end{example}
\vfill

Notice that we could also solve the problem above by examining the sample space and counting all the numbers that fit the description ``6 or odd.''  You'll find that there are often multiple ways to solve probability problems.
\vfill

\begin{try}
If you roll a fair six-sided die once, what is the probability of getting a 5 or a number less than 2? 
\end{try}
\vfill

Here's the formula for mutually exclusive, or disjoint, events:
\begin{formula}{Addition rule for mutually exclusive events}
If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are mutually exclusive events, then 
 \[  P(A_1 \mbox{ or } A_2) =  P(A_1) +  P(A_2) \]
Furthermore, we can generalize this rule for finitely many disjoint events (where $n$ is the number of events):
\[  P(A_1 \mbox{ or } A_2  \dots \mbox{ or } A_n) =  P(A_1) +  P(A_2) + \dots + P(A_n) \]
\end{formula} 
\vfill

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD6AB7t_Das]{Drawing a card}
Suppose you draw one card from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that you get an Ace or a face card? 

\sol
There are 4 Aces and 12 face cards in a standard deck of cards. These outcomes are disjoint, since only one card is drawn and Aces and face cards are distinct, so we find the probability as follows:
\begin{align*}
P( A \mbox{ or } F ) &= P(A) + P(F)\\
&= \frac{4}{52} + \frac{12}{52}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13} \approx 0.308}
\end{align*}
\end{example}
\vfill

\begin{try}
If one card is randomly selected from a deck, what is the probability of getting a number or a red Jack? If one card is randomly selected from a deck, what is the probability of selecting a red suit or a black suit?
\end{try}
\vfill
\pagebreak

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS3h94W2Lnk]{Marbles}
A large bag contains 28 marbles: 7 are blue, 8 are yellow, 3 are white, and 10 are  red. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item If one marble is randomly selected, what is the probability that it is either red or yellow?
\item If one marble is randomly selected, what is the probability that it is neither white nor red?
\end{enumerate}

\sol
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Clearly, selecting a red or yellow marble are disjoint events, so we find the answer by adding together the individual probabilities:
\begin{align*}
P( R \mbox{ or } Y ) &= P(R) + P(Y)\\
&= \frac{10}{28} + \frac{8}{28}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{18}{28} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643}
\end{align*}
\item A question involving ``neither/nor'' is different from a question involving ``either/or'', because NOT white and NOT red are not mutually exclusive events.  Thus, to answer this question, we will simply count how many marbles are not white and also not red.  This includes the blue and yellow marbles, for a total of $7 + 8 = 15$:
\[P(\textrm{not } W \textrm{ and not } R) = \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28} \approx 0.54}\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{try}
A bag of M\&M's contains the following candies:  12 are brown, 20 are yellow, 14 are red, 8 are green, and 16 are orange. If one candy is randomly selected, what is the probability that it's either brown or green? 
\end{try}

\subsection{Overlapping Events}
What if the events of interest are not mutually exclusive? How do we compute probabilities of events that are not disjoint? Pictorially, we can visualize this situation with the following diagram, where the red intersection of two circles represents all outcomes when two events both happen. For example, if we consider FCC students, selecting a female and selecting a full-time students would not be mutually exclusive events, since there are certainly female students who go to school full time.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw [very thick,color=red, fill=red!20] (-0.8,0) circle (1.2cm);
  \draw [yshift=-1.8cm,xshift=-0.8cm] node {\color{red}\Large $A$};
  
  \draw [very thick,color=blue, fill=blue!20] (0.8,0) circle (1.2cm);
  \draw [yshift=-1.8cm,xshift=0.8cm] node {\color{blue}\Large $B$};
  
  \draw [ultra thick,color=blue!50!red, fill=blue!50!red] (0,-0.9) arc (-45:45:1.28cm);
  \draw [ultra thick,color=blue!50!red, fill=blue!50!red] (-0.03,0.89) arc (135:225:1.24cm);
  \draw [ultra thick,color=blue!50!red] (0,-0.9) -- (0,0.9);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What happens if we try to approach a question about being in $A$ or $B$ by adding the individual probabilities?  Notice that if we add the red and blue circles, the purple area in the middle gets counted \textbf{twice}, once when we account for the red circle and once for the blue circle.  Since this will always happen, we can adjust our answer by simply \emph{subtracting} the overlapping region once from the sum.

As long as we can calculate the overlapping probability (the probably of \emph{both} occurring), this problem isn't much more complicated.
\pagebreak

Let's go back to the deck of cards to see an example of how to calculate probabilities with overlapping events.  We'll again use the example of drawing a Jack or a diamond.
\vspace{0.1in}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{playingcardsJD}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.1in}

As we noted already, these are not mutually exclusive events.  Because of that, adding the probability of drawing a Jack (4/52) and the probability of drawing a diamond (13/52) gave an incorrect answer of 17/52, where the correct probability--as we noted earlier--is 16/52.  Again, this is because we \textit{double counted} the Jack of diamonds, once when we calculated the probability of drawing a Jack and once when we calculated the probability of a diamond.

The way to correct for this double counting is to subtract off the overlap; thus, we'll add up the probability of drawing a Jack and the probability of drawing a diamond, and then subtract the probability of drawing both together (i.e. of drawing the Jack of diamonds):
\[P(J \ OR \ D) = P(J)+P(D)-P(JD) = \dfrac{4}{52}+\dfrac{13}{52}-\dfrac{1}{52} = \dfrac{16}{52}\]
\vfill

In general, to calculate probabilities of compound events that are not mutually exclusive, we will use the General Addition rule:
\vfill

\begin{formula}{General Addition rule}
If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are any events, then 
 \[  P(A_1 \mbox{ or } A_2) =  P(A_1) +  P(A_2) - P( A_1 \mbox{ and } A_2 ) \]
\end{formula}
\vfill

Notice that this is a more general form of the addition rule we stated earlier, with mutually exclusive events.  If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of them occurring together is 0, so the general addition rule simplifies down in that case to the simpler addition rule.
\vfill
 
\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx7DRG6N1r8]{Drawing a card}
Suppose you draw one card from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that you get a King or a spade? 

\sol
There are 4 Kings and 13 spades, where one of these cards is a King of spades. Drawing the King of spades means both events happen at the same time, so these events are not mutually exclusive. To compute the probability correctly, we need to make sure we don't ``double count'' any of the outcomes, and in this case it is drawing the King of spades. Applying the general addition rule, we get
\begin{align*}
P( K \mbox{ or } S ) &= P(K) + P(S) - P(K \mbox{ and } S)\\
&= \frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13} \approx 0.308}
\end{align*}
By subtracting $P(K \mbox{ and } S)$, we guarantee that we count the King of Spades only once.
\end{example}

\begin{try}
Suppose you draw one card from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that you get a Queen or a face card? 
\end{try}

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3FKbz7RnSs]{FCC students}
Consider the following information about a group of 130 FCC students:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | c c c}
\textbf{Gender} & \textbf{Right-handed} & \textbf{Left-handed} & \textbf{Total} \\ \hline 
\textbf{Female} & 58 & 13 & 71\\
\textbf{Male} & 47 & 12 & 59  \\ \hline
\textbf{Total} & 105 & 25 & 130 \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If one person is randomly selected from the group, what is the probability this student is female or left-handed? 

\sol
These events are not disjoint, since there are 13 females who are left-handed. Thus, we apply the general addition formula:
\[P(F \mbox{ or } L) = P(F) + P(L) - P(F \textrm{ and } L)\]
Notice that $P(F)$ and $P(L)$ can be found by looking for the total number of each (the total of the female row and the left-handed column), and $P(F$ and $L)$ uses the number of students in the intersection of this row and column.
\begin{align*}
P(F \mbox{ or } L) &= P(F) + P(L) - P(F \textrm{ and } L)\\
&= \frac{71}{130} + \frac{25}{130} - \frac{13}{130}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{83}{130} \approx 0.638}
\end{align*}
Notice that the only students not ``qualifying'' for the event of interest are right-handed males. There are 47 of them, and 130 - 47 = 83. \\

We could, of course, solve this problem by highlighting the values in the table that apply, and then simply add them individually:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
\textbf{Gender} & \textbf{Right-handed} & \textbf{Left-handed} & \textbf{Total} \\ \hline 
& & & \\
\textbf{Female} & {\Large\color{red} \boxed{58}} & {\Large\color{red} \boxed{13}} & 71\\
& & & \\
\textbf{Male} & 47 & {\Large\color{red} \boxed{12}} & 59  \\ 
& & & \\ \hline
\textbf{Total} & 105 & 25 & 130 \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Adding these up gives the same total for the number of qualifying students.
\[58 + 13 + 12 = 83\]

Once again, there are often many ways to solve a probability problem; our goal is to have as many tools as possible, so that we can select the easiest approach.

\sol
Notice that having a red car and getting a speeding ticket are not mutually exclusive events, since 15 people had both. Thus, we perform the following computations: \\

\emph{P(red car) + P(got a speeding ticket) $-$ P(red car and got a speeding ticket)}\\

Once again, we simply need to add the totals for the red car row and the speeding ticket column, then subtract the value in the intersection of these (and then of course divide this by the total number of observations).

\[\frac{150}{665} + \frac{60}{665} - \frac{15}{665}  = \boxed{\frac{195}{665}  \approx 0.293}\]

\subsection{Complements}
\marginnote{Remember, there are generally multiple ways to solve a probability problem.  Here we'll find a valuable tool that allows us to look at problems from a new angle.}
The probability of an event not occurring can be just as useful as computing the probability of that event happening. The best way to introduce this concept is to consider an example. Let's revisit the standard 52-card deck, where we randomly select one card:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{playingcards}
\end{center}

What is the probability of not drawing an Ace? Well, you know that there are 4 Aces in the deck, so $52 - 4 = 48$ cards that are not Aces. We compute:
\[ P(\mbox{not Ace}) = \frac{48}{52} \approx 0.923 \]
Now, notice that 
\[  \frac{48}{52} = 1 - \frac{4}{52}, \mbox{ where } P(Ace) = \frac{4}{52}\]
This is not a coincidence. If you recall the basic rules of probability, the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must be 1. In this case, the card you draw is either Ace or it's not, so it makes sense that the probabilities of these two events add up to 1. 
%%% NOT %%%

\begin{formula}{Complement of an event}
The complement of an event $A$  is denoted by $A^c$ and represents all outcomes not in $A$. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 $
	\item $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) $ 
	\item $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) $ 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpjdHUsKaow]{Not hearts!}
If you pull a random card, what is the probability it is not a
heart? 

\sol
There are 13 hearts in the deck, so $P(\mbox{hearts}) = 13/52 = 1/4$. The probability of not drawing a heart is the complement:
\begin{align*}
P(\mbox{not hearts}) &= 1 - P(\mbox{hearts})\\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{4}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{3}{4} = 0.75}

Let's consider an example that might be more relevant to you as a student: 

\begin{example}[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=munZCN0L2uA]{Multiple choice question}
A multiple choice question has 5 answers, and exactly one of them is correct. If you were to guess, what is the probability of not getting the correct answer? 

\sol
Since only one of the answers is correct, we have $P(\mbox{correct}) = 1/5$, so
\begin{align*}
P(\mbox{not correct}) &= 1 - P(\mbox{correct})\\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{5}\\
&= \boxed{\frac{4}{5} = 0.8}

\begin{try}
A multiple choice question has 6 answers, and exactly two of them are correct. If you were to guess, what is the probability of not getting the correct answer?  If a test has 4 questions with 6 possible answers, what is the probability of not getting any of the questions correct? (\emph{You are technically not ready to answer this part of the question just yet, but it is a good exercise to think about!})

The probability of selecting a female student is 0.57, so using the complement rule, we compute:
