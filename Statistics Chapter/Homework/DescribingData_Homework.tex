\emph{For problems 1--18, use the dataset shown in the table below.  This is a sample of 15 players in Major League Baseball, chosen from the starting lineups of teams in 2019.  The table shows the team, age, position, height, and salary for each player, as well as several statistics from that season.  These include the number of games they played (G), their batting average (AVE) (the proportion of their at-bats for which they got a hit), and their home runs (HR).}
